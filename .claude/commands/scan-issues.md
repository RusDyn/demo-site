# Scan Codebase for Issues: $ARGUMENTS

I'll scan your codebase for common issues and create a report.

## What I'll Check

**Code Quality:**
- TODO/FIXME comments
- Console.log statements  
- TypeScript @ts-ignore usage
- Hardcoded values
- Missing error handling

**Security:**
- Hardcoded credentials
- Missing input validation
- SQL injection risks

**Technical Debt:**
- Deprecated API usage
- Missing tests
- Complex functions
- Duplicate code

## Output

I'll provide a prioritized list of issues found with:
- Location (file:line)
- Issue description
- Suggested fix
- Priority level

Let me know which directories to scan and I'll get started.
