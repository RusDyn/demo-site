# Post-Incident Review: $ARGUMENTS

I'll help you create a comprehensive post-incident review. This is crucial for learning and preventing future incidents.

## 1. Incident Summary

First, let's gather the basic information:
- **Incident ID/Title**: [I'll help generate]
- **Date**: [When did it occur?]
- **Duration**: [Total downtime/impact time]
- **Severity**: [P0/P1/P2]
- **Services Affected**: [Which services/features?]

## 2. Timeline Reconstruction

I'll help you build a detailed timeline:
- When was the issue first detected?
- How was it detected? (alerts, customer reports, etc.)
- What were the key events during resolution?
- When was it fully resolved?

## 3. Impact Analysis

Let's quantify the impact:
- Number of users affected
- Revenue/business impact
- SLA violations
- Customer complaints received

## 4. Root Cause Analysis

I'll guide you through:
- What was the immediate cause?
- What were the contributing factors?
- Why did our systems/processes fail to prevent this?
- Use the "5 Whys" technique

## 5. What Went Well

Important to recognize:
- Effective responses
- Quick decisions that helped
- Team coordination successes
- Tools that worked as expected

## 6. What Went Poorly

Be honest about:
- Delayed responses
- Communication failures
- Missing tools/runbooks
- Process breakdowns

## 7. Action Items

I'll help create specific, actionable improvements:
- [ ] Technical fixes (with owners and deadlines)
- [ ] Process improvements
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting additions
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Training needs

## 8. Lessons Learned

Key takeaways for the team:
- Technical lessons
- Process lessons
- Communication lessons

## Template Output

I'll generate a formatted document you can share with:
- Executive summary
- Detailed timeline
- Action items with owners
- Follow-up meeting agenda

**Let's start**: Can you provide the incident details and timeline? I'll help structure this into a comprehensive review that drives real improvements.
