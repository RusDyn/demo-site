# Check for Code Duplication

Analyze the codebase for duplicate or similar functionality.

## Process:
1. Search for similar function names and patterns
2. Identify duplicate logic blocks
3. Find repeated utility functions
4. Check for similar type definitions
5. Suggest consolidation opportunities

## Output Format:
- List of potential duplicates with file locations
- Similarity assessment (identical, similar, related)
- Consolidation recommendations
- Impact analysis for proposed changes

Focus on functional duplicates, not just textual similarity.
