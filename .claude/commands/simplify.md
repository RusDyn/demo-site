# Simplify Existing Code

You are tasked with simplifying overly complex code while maintaining functionality.

## Process:
1. Analyze the provided code for complexity issues
2. Identify opportunities to:
   - Reduce nesting levels
   - Extract reusable functions
   - Remove unnecessary abstractions
   - Simplify logic flow
3. Implement changes incrementally
4. Run tests after each change
5. Document any behavior changes

## Guidelines:
- Prefer explicit over clever
- Reduce cyclomatic complexity
- Eliminate dead code
- Use early returns to reduce nesting

Provide the refactored code with explanations for each simplification.
